//! TCP listener + session threads for the KISS bridge
//! (BRIDGE_PLAN Phase 2 + Phase 4).
//!
//! Contract (pinned — do not change signatures):
//!   - `start(bus)` spawns the 16 KB accept thread and returns
//!     immediately. Call only after WiFi bring-up succeeds: binding
//!     without lwIP initialization asserts rather than returning Err.
//!     The listener binds 0.0.0.0:7633; a failed bind retries every 5 s
//!     instead of killing the thread.
//!   - Max 2 concurrent sessions (one laptop + one debug client);
//!     further connections are accepted, logged, shut down and dropped
//!     (polite reject — never left half-open).
//!   - TCP_NODELAY on every accepted stream (KISS is tiny frames).
//!   - ALL logging via `crate::clog!` — never `println!`.
//!
//! Session layout — ONE 12 KB thread per session (deviation from the
//! plan's 8 KB: the 8 KB budget + 1 KB read buffer + error-format
//! frames proved tight, and an ESP-IDF stack overflow in the std::net
//! paths is a silent reboot, not a catchable error), not a
//! reader/writer pair: `SessionGuard` owns the outbound `Receiver` and
//! its `Drop` must run exactly once, so it cannot be handed to a second
//! thread — a separate writer parked in `recv()` could never be woken
//! by the reader's exit (the classic stuck-session bug). One thread
//! owning BOTH directions removes the coordination entirely:
//!   - inbound: blocking `read` with a 10 ms SO_RCVTIMEO (returns the
//!     instant the host sends) -> `bus.send_in(id, bytes)` (blocks when
//!     the modem queue is full = intended TCP backpressure)
//!   - outbound: after every read attempt, drain `guard.rx` with
//!     `try_recv` -> `write_all` of the pre-framed KISS frame (worst
//!     case 10 ms extra latency — harmless next to RNS's 250 ms
//!     config-echo validation window)
//! On ANY exit path: `shutdown(Both)` (FIN/RST to the peer), the RAII
//! slot decrements the session count, and the `SessionGuard` drop
//! unregisters the session and notifies the modem (`InMsg::Leave`).
//!
//! The KISS parser does NOT live here: raw bytes go to the modem thread
//! which owns `Modem::feed`; outbound frames arrive pre-framed.
